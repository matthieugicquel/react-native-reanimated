and velocity nodes by running a single step of animation each time this node evaluates. State variable finished is set to 1 when the animation gets to the final point (that is the velocity drops under the level of significance). The time state node is populated automatically by this node and refers to the last clock time this node got evaluated. It is expected to be reset each time we want to restart the animation. Decay animation can be configured using deceleration config param and it controls how fast the animation decelerates. The value should be between 0 and 1 but only values that are close to 1 will yield meaningful results.","sidebar":"docs"},"animations/spring":{"id":"animations/spring","title":"Spring","description":"When evaluated, updates position and velocity nodes by running a single step of spring based animation. Check the original Animated API docs to learn about the config parameters like damping, mass, stiffness, overshootClamping, restSpeedThreshold and restDisplacementThreshold. The finished state updates to 1 when the position reaches the destination set by toValue. The time state variable also updates when the node evaluates and it represents the clock value at the time when the node got evaluated for the last time. It is expected that time variable is reset before spring animation can be restarted.","sidebar":"docs"},"animations/spring_utils":{"id":"animations/spring_utils","title":"SpringUtils","description":"For developers\' convenience, it\'s possible to use a different way of configuring spring animation which follows behavior known from React Native core.","sidebar":"docs"},"animations/timing":{"id":"animations/timing","title":"Timing","description":"Updates position node by running timing based animation from a given position to a destination determined by toValue.

This component renders null, so you can place it in any place you want in your render method. It is required that your code is put inside component as we rely on componentDidMount and componentWillUnmount callbacks to install and cleanup animated nodes. Note that the code you put is going to be executed only once. We currently have no way of telling if your code changes and so it will only be run in componentDidMount. If you wish for your reanimated nodes to be updated when the component updates, you can update the key property of the Animated.Code component, which will effectively unmount the old and mount the new versions of it in the React tree. You can provide dependencies key which works just like the second argument in useCode.","sidebar":"docs"},"config":{"id":"config","title":"Additional configuration","description":"Reanimated exports two functions that control which properties can be animated natively:","sidebar":"docs"},"declarative":{"id":"declarative","title":"Declarative Animation API","description":"Invoking animation differs from the way it is done when using the original Animated API.","sidebar":"docs"},"event":{"id":"event","title":"Event handling with reanimated nodes","description":"react-native-reanimated\'s new syntax is possible to be used with Animated.event.
